# ðŸ§  Day 4 â€“ Java Methods (Theory)

Today I focused on learning **Java methods**, one of the most important and reusable parts of Java programming.  
I didnâ€™t do problem-solving today as Iâ€™m traveling to Shirdi ðŸ›•, but I made sure to study method syntax, types, and examples deeply.

I covered deep theory on:

- âœ… Java Methods (Static & Instance)
- âœ… Access Modifiers (public, private, protected, default)
- âœ… Command Line Arguments
- âœ… Variable Arguments (Varargs)

## ðŸ“˜ What Is a Method in Java?

A **method** in Java is a block of code that performs a specific task.  
It helps keep the code modular, reusable, clean, and easy to debug.

## ðŸ’­ Reflection
Todayâ€™s focus was fully on understanding how methods work, how to create different types, and how to call them.
Even though I didnâ€™t write problems, I now feel confident about using methods to organize logic.

Being in Shirdi didnâ€™t stop me â€” and Iâ€™m proud I stayed committed to the journey âœ¨
This theory will directly help me in solving modular DSA problems starting tomorrow.
