ðŸ§  **Day 4 â€“ Java Methods (Theory)**  
Today I focused on learning Java methods â€” one of the most powerful and reusable features in Java programming.

Though I didnâ€™t do problem-solving today (currently traveling to Shirdi ðŸ›•), I made sure to stay consistent by deeply understanding method syntax, types, and usage.



### âœ… What I Covered
- Java Methods (Static & Instance)
- Access Modifiers (public, private, protected, default)
- Command Line Arguments
- Variable Arguments (Varargs)



ðŸ“˜ **What Is a Method in Java?**  
A method in Java is a block of code that performs a specific task.  
It helps keep code modular, reusable, clean, and easy to debug.



ðŸ’­ **Reflection**  
Todayâ€™s focus was all about understanding how Java methods work â€” from declaration to execution. I didnâ€™t solve problems, but I now feel confident enough to break down and write logic in modular pieces.

Even while being in Shirdi, I stayed consistent â€” and Iâ€™m proud of that. âœ¨  
This foundation will make tomorrowâ€™s DSA problem-solving smoother and cleaner ðŸ’ª
