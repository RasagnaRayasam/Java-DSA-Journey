# 🧠 Day 4 – Java Methods (Theory)

Today I focused on learning **Java methods**, one of the most important and reusable parts of Java programming.  
I didn’t do problem-solving today as I’m traveling to Shirdi 🛕, but I made sure to study method syntax, types, and examples deeply.

## 📘 What Is a Method in Java?

A **method** in Java is a block of code that performs a specific task.  
It helps keep the code modular, reusable, clean, and easy to debug.

## 💭 Reflection
Today’s focus was fully on understanding how methods work, how to create different types, and how to call them.
Even though I didn’t write problems, I now feel confident about using methods to organize logic.

Being in Shirdi didn’t stop me — and I’m proud I stayed committed to the journey ✨
This theory will directly help me in solving modular DSA problems starting tomorrow.
