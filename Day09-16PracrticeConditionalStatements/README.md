- Learnt how Java takes input using Scanner
- Understood why Java input behaves differently from Python
- Learnt to run Java from:
  - Terminal using `javac` and `java`
  - VS Code using Run and Debug options



## 🧠 Java vs Python Input

🟢 In Python, input() can be reused endlessly inside a loop — it's flexible.

🔴 In Java, Scanner reads input only once unless it's in a loop, and you MUST close it after use to avoid warnings.



## 🧾 Key Learnings

- `Scanner` is used to take input in Java.
- Java requires closing objects like `Scanner` using `.close()` to prevent memory leaks.
- Java code is compiled to `.class` files, and needs:
  - `javac FileName.java` to compile
  - `java ClassName` to run
- If class name and file name don't match, Java will throw errors.
- If you're using VS Code "Run" button, the input must be typed in the **Debug Console**, not terminal.
- Input isn't taken like Python (repetitive), so you have to be careful with how many times you call `scanner.nextInt()` or `scanner.nextLine()`.



## 🔍 Realizations

- Felt overwhelmed because Java wasn’t behaving like Python 😓
- Kept editing code but terminal output wasn’t updating — realized `.class` file wasn't recompiling!
- Understood that each `.java` file needs to be compiled before running
- Learned importance of correct file names and paths



## 💬 Thoughts

> “Java is strict and structured. Python feels free. Both are good — just different mindsets.”  
> “Closing objects, recompiling, input methods — all make you think deeper.”  
> “I'm proud I didn’t quit even when I felt frustrated. This is growth!” 💪



## 🧘 Mood

Started with confusion and frustration.  
Ended with **clarity, patience**, and solid understanding. 

🦸‍♀️ “Bit by bit, byte by byte — I’m building mastery in Java!”
💜 Great progress, Rasagnaaa! Keep it going strong 🔥✨
