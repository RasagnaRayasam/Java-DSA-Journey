# 📘 Day 2 – Java Theory Deep Dive (No Practical)

Hey! Today was fully theory-based, but super productive 🙌  
I focused on understanding the **core Java building blocks**, which will help me write cleaner and more professional code in the coming days 💻✨

## 🔍 Topics Covered

- ✅ **Comments in Java**
  - Single-line: `//`
  - Multi-line: `/* ... */`
  - Documentation: `/** ... */`
  
- ✅ **Naming Conventions**
  - camelCase for variables and methods
  - PascalCase for class names
  - UPPER_SNAKE_CASE for constants

- ✅ **Identifiers and Keywords**
  - Learned what valid identifiers are
  - Reserved keywords like `class`, `public`, `void`, etc.

- ✅ **Java Modifiers**
  - Access Modifiers: `public`, `private`, `protected`
  - Non-Access Modifiers: `final`, `static`, `abstract`

- ✅ **Java Variables**
  - Local
  - Instance (non-static)
  - Static

- ✅ **Data Types**
  - Primitive: `int`, `float`, `char`, `boolean`, etc.
  - Non-Primitive: `String`, `Array`, `Class`, `Object`

- ✅ **Type Casting**
  - Implicit (widening)
  - Explicit (narrowing)

- ✅ **User Input in Java**
  - Using `Scanner` class
  - Import syntax and basic examples

- ✅ **Date and Time in Java**
  - `LocalDate`, `LocalTime`, and `LocalDateTime`
  - How to print current date and time

## 💭 Reflection

Today was more of a reading & understanding day — no coding yet, but I covered a LOT of foundational theory like Java variables, type casting, user input, and even date/time.

It honestly felt like a brain workout 🧠💥 — but I’m glad I took the time to really understand the “why” behind Java’s structure.

Feeling prepped to jump into hands-on practice tomorrow! ✌️
