# 🧠 Day 5 – Java Revision Day (Methods + Inputs)

Today I took a step back to **revise and solidify everything I’ve learned so far** in my Java DSA journey. Instead of jumping to new concepts, I wanted to ensure that all the foundational topics are clear before diving into problems tomorrow.



## ✅ What I Revised Today

- 🧩 Java Basics: Hello World, Data Types, Variables, Type Casting
- ✳️ Modifiers, Keywords, Comments, Identifiers, Naming Conventions
- 🧠 Java Methods (static vs instance)
- 🔐 Access Modifiers (public, private, protected, default)
- 💡 Command Line Arguments
- 📦 Variable Arguments (Varargs)


## 💭 Reflection

I believe revision is just as important as learning new things.  
Today’s session helped me **connect the dots** between theory and how these features will support my DSA practice.

Even without coding new problems, I made real progress by:
- Rewriting handwritten notes,
- Reviewing code examples,
- And mentally mapping how these concepts interact.

📚 Every day counts — and today was about **reinforcing** what I’ve built so far.  
Strong base = Strong growth! 💪✨
