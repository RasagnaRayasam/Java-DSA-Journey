📅 Day 9 – Java DSA Journey
✅ What I Did Today
Practiced Java problems:

✔️ Check if a number is Even or Odd

✔️ Check if a number is Positive or Negative

Explored and understood VS Code setup for Java

Fixed issues related to running .java files inside folders

Got comfortable using javac and java from terminal


📚 Key Learnings
🧠 Scanner input behavior in Java vs Python:

In Java, Scanner reads input only once unless explicitly looped

In Python, input() can be called infinitely — more flexible

⚠️ In Java, we must close objects (like Scanner) to avoid warnings or memory leaks


🔧 VS Code Setup Notes
Understood how folders, class names, and file names should match

Learned how to debug slow running or cached outputs in VS Code

Figured out how .class files are generated and when to recompile


💡 Concepts Revised
if, else, else if conditions

System.out.println() for output

Scanner class for input

File & folder naming conventions


🦸‍♀️ “Bit by bit, byte by byte — I’m building mastery in Java!”
💜 Great progress, Rasagnaaa! Keep it going strong 🔥✨
