# 💻 Day 3 – Java Operators, Conditionals & Loops (Theory Only)

Today I focused on the **theoretical understanding** of Java logic blocks like operators, conditionals, and loops.  
Even though I didn’t get hands-on with code today, I went through concepts thoroughly and made mental notes for when I practice them.



## 📚 Topics Reviewed

- 🔢 **Operators in Java**
  - Arithmetic, Relational, Logical, Assignment, Unary
- 🔁 **Conditional Statements**
  - `if`, `else`, `else if`, `switch-case`
- 🔁 **Loops**
  - `for`, `while`, `do-while`
  - Loop flow control using `break` and `continue`



## 💭 Reflection

Didn’t get time to write code today, but I stayed on track and made sure I didn’t break the flow.  
Hoping to implement all of these tomorrow with lots of practice problems and logic building 💪

This is still Day 3 — and I’m proud I didn’t skip it entirely. Showing up is what matters 💙\

Thank you
