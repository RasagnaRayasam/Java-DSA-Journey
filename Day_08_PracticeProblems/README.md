# 🚀 Java DSA Journey – Day 7

## 📅 Date: [Replace with today's date]

## ✅ What I Did Today

Today, I shifted from just learning theory to **applying** it 💪  
I started solving **loop-based problems** to strengthen my logic and Java syntax.


## 🔁 Topics Practiced

- `for` loops
- `while` loops
- `do-while` basics
- Nested loops
- Condition checking inside loops


## 💡 What I Learned

- How to use loops effectively for logic building
- Realized the difference between `++i` and `i++` in loop control
- Got better at debugging small logic issues
- Applied theory into actual working code


## 💬 Reflection

Although the pace feels a bit slow, I realized that mastering the **basics with clarity** is more important than rushing.  
Every problem I solve builds my confidence and gets me closer to becoming a rockstar dev 🤘

I remind myself:
> 🎯 **Consistency > Speed**  
> 💪 “Slow progress is better than no progress.”

I’ll keep going. One day, I’ll look back and thank myself for not giving up today. 💖



## 🌱 Next Steps

- More loop-based problems tomorrow
- Start practicing arrays after feeling strong in loops
- Try mixing loops with conditions and functions
